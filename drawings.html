    <h1>Drawings</h1>
	
	<p>Drawing is one of my favorite ways to pass the time. Most of my insperation comes from anime.
	  Here are some of my personal favorite drawings that I have drawn.
	</p>
	
	<div>
	  <img src="images/Akame.jpg" alt="A picture of Akame Hinowa holding a katana" width="350" height="250">
	  <p>This drawing was inspired by the charcter Akame from the anime Akame ga kill and is one
	     of my favorite drawings that I have made. I chose a specific scene that I liked and did
		 my best to draw it and shade it properly.

	<div>
	  <img src="images/kiyotaka.jpg" alt="A picture of Ajanokoji Kiyotaka sitting down with a white background" width="350" height="250">
	  <p>I took insperation for this drawing from the anime classroom of the elite. The character I drew 
	     is the main charcter Ajanokoji, he potrayed to be smart and composed which is why he is my favorite
		 charcter of the anime. I used an image I found on google to use as refernce for his pose.
